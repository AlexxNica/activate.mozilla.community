*Diversity & Inclusion helps us achieve our mission: 
”To ensure the Internet is a global public resource open and accessible to all.”*

Community Participation Guidelines are global guidelines that apply to everyone in the Mozilla community - staff and volunteers.   It presents a vision for the Mozilla community we want to have, and lays out behavior expectations, processes to raise concerns, and consequences.  The CPG is governed by owners of forums, events and activities supported by Employee Relations and the D&I team.

 A a narrative is a way of taking something you learn and making it your own.

Narrative can be produced in any format: text(blog, forum post), blog, video etc.
