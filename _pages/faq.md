## What's Activate Mozilla?

Activate Mozilla is a Mozilla initiative to bring more clarity on what are the most important areas to contribute to at Mozilla right now, and provide clear steps on how to get involved right away. These will be presented in the form of activities.

## Who can be involved in the activities?

Anyone who wants to support Mozilla.

## How do I get involved?

Just navigate the site and read the different areas and activities described. There you will find more information on why the activities have been chosen, and concrete instructions on how to contribute to each of them.

## Why should I get involved?

The areas and activity described in this site are a result of a joint effort from the Mozilla Participation team and different functional areas to surface what is imporant for the organization right now. If you want to support Mozilla and you are unsure about what's more impactful right now, this is your site.

## What should I do if I have questions?

You can ask directly creating a new topic at the [Participation Leaders forum](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/participation-leaders).

## Can I request budget for these activities?

Unless otherwise explicitely stated, the answer is no. These are no budget activities / events, meaning that Mozilla will not provide financial support. While we are dreaming up new and interesting ways to support, these should be very much self-directed activities.
