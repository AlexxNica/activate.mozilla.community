## What's Activate Mozilla?

Activate Mozilla is a Mozilla initiative to bring more clarity on what are the most important areas to contribute to at Mozilla right now, and provide clear steps on how to get involved right away. These will be presented in the form of activities.

## Who can be involved in the activities?

Anyone who wants to support Mozilla.

## How do I get involved?

Just navigate the site and read the different areas and activities described. There you will find more information on why the activities have been chosen, and concrete instructions on how to contribute to each of them.

## Why should I get involved?

The areas and activity described in this site are a result of a joint effort from the Mozilla Participation team and different functional areas to surface what is imporant for the organization right now. If you want to support Mozilla and you are unsure about what's more impactful right now, this is your site.

## What should I do if I have questions?

You can ask directly creating a new topic at the [Participation Leaders forum](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/participation-leaders).

## Can I request budget or swag for these activities?

We encourage you to run these as lean as possible, but realise that sometimes there can be some costs incurred for logistics or refreshments. If your event meets the requirements laid out in the activity, there is a fund available of up to $150 USD per event. This can be used for only the following items/services:

* Locally produced stickers and/or other small items (only for an event for over 50 people)
* Food for participants for an event over than 5 hours
* Venue rental (in the case of the no other alternative)
* Travel for expert on the field (currently allowed only for Rust events)

Assets to use will be included in some activities. Unless explicitly mentioned in the activity, there will be no other swag available for the campaign. 

To make the request, you will need to make a Reps budget request. If you are not a Rep, please contact a local Rep to help you. We will fast-track valid requests, which are ones that meet the requirements of the activity. For larger budget requests, it will be processed like any other Reps budget request and there is no guarantee it will be approved and even if so, whether it will be on time.
