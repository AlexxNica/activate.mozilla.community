*Diversity & Inclusion helps us achieve our mission:
”To ensure the Internet is a global public resource open and accessible to all.”*

Community Participation Guidelines are global guidelines that apply to everyone in the Mozilla community - staff and volunteers.   The CPG presents a vision for Mozilla's community, and lays out behavior expectations, processes to raise concerns, and consequences.  The CPG is governed by owners of forums, events and activities supported by Employee Relations and the D&I team.

**2. Connected Task**

 A narrative is a way of taking something you learn and making it your own. In reviewing the CPG, we are asking for your feedback, but also for how you personalize the value, impact and opportunity provided by clear and supported participation guidelines through narrative.  Narrative can be produced in any format: text(blog, forum post), blog, video etc.

*Learn more about creating Narrative, by reading [Julien Stodd's post on the topic](https://julianstodd.wordpress.com/2013/08/06/narrative/).*

Choose from one of these 2 options for narrative:

* **Personal Narrative**: Share your narrative (in any format) and feedback on the CPG on this [Discourse topic](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/community-participation-guidelines-draft-community-feedback/13816).  If you want to provide anonymous feedback on the CPG, please email inclusion@mozilla.com .
* **Community Co-Created Narrative**: Share the CPG draft with others in the community to co-create a narrative (in any format) to post on this [Discourse topic](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/community-participation-guidelines-draft-community-feedback/13816) or share anonymously to inclusion@mozilla.com .

**NOTE**: Inclusion email reaches our VP of People and D&I Team.
