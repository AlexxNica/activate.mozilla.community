# About Participation at Mozilla


## Our Mission

To have Mozilla succeed through openness and participation

## What We Do

The Participation Team develops community leaders and contributors who will invent, shape and defend the Internet, and activates them to supercharge Mozillaâ€™s products and our movement.

We do this by:

* Designing and implementing specific participation initiatives -- in partnership with teams around Mozilla -- that adapt and advance global best-practice on participation
* Recruiting and investing in core contributors mobilizers/leaders, and developing diverse, local and global communities that make individual contribution more impactful
* Delivering software/systems and practices that increase the impact of participation across Mozilla
