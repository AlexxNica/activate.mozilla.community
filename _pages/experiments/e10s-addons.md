Featured add-ons receive enhanced promotion on AMO, which results in greatly increased installs for this recommended content. With the emergence of multiprocess Firefox (e10s), we need to ensure these spotlighted add-ons meet the highest levels of browser compatibility and functionality.

__NOTE: This activity is running only until November 4th, 2016__.

## Impact and Metrics

Millions of Firefox users have installed add-ons directly from the [Featured Add-ons collection](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/?sort=featured). They expect and trust Mozilla to guide them to the very best add-ons content. Ensuring compatibility with the latest browser technology, in this case e10s—which will be turned on for Firefox with Firefox 50 (November 8) who have compatible add-ons—is critical to the claim that these featured add-ons deserve their attention. 

### Goals for this area

__Impact:__

* 55 featured add-ons, with <100k users, are tested
* 400 add-on tests

__Strength:__

* 15 Mobilizers activated
* 200 add-on testers at events

## Audience for this activity

This is for participants with an interest or passion for add-ons content from a user experience perspective. You do not need any particular technical skills, but rather an ability to install add-ons and test their features to ensure the content works as expected with multiprocess Firefox.

## Activity Format

While this activity can be run solo, we encourage you to run an event in your community to get together people who care about the Web. The goal is to test sites, diagnose problems, and discuss how to evangelise locally to developers about a Web that works for everyone.

1. Put an event team together
2. Choose a date and secure a venue
3. Setup the event on Reps Portal ([instructions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Event_hosting)). [Find a Rep](https://reps.mozilla.org/people/) closeby to do this if you are not one.

For duration, we recommend 2-3 hours with 10-15 attendees.

## Event Flow

### Introduction

* Give a quick introduction to attendees about what we are doing and why it is important. The main point is that with more compatible add-ons, e10s will roll out faster to potentially millions more Firefox users.
* Ask attendees to tweet about their attendance. Here is a suggested message:
    * I’m helping more @Firefox add-ons to become compatible with new cutting edge technology <link of this page> #MozActivate

### Steps to test...

1. Create a new Firefox profile by going to about:profiles => “Create new profile”. Enter a name and click Done. Then click “Launch profile in new browser” to launch it.
2. Install the ["Add-on Compatibility Reporter"](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter?src=external-activate1) add-on.
3. Install an add-on that has yet to be tested from [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_yalc35gtlbcdJmS0-cKB1CEqE5FU4ti3oA7GFp406g/edit#gid=0).
4. Go to about:addons and make sure that it says “Multiprocess is enabled” in the top right corner and “Compatible with multiprocess” for the add-on you are testing.
5. Test the main functionality of the add-on. Does it perform as expected? 
  1. Spend the time necessary to test the main features and functions of the add-on. This often takes anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes.   
6. Write “Yes” in column C if the add-on works as expected; write “No” if it does not.
  1. Though not necessary, feel free to write any notes in column D on problematic issues you found. 
  2. If the add-on does NOT work as expected, go to the Extensions tab in the Add-ons Manager (about:addons), find the problematic add-on, and click Report Issue. 
7. Once you’re finished testing an add-on, uninstall it from the Add-ons Manager before installing a new add-on to test. 

## Output

Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Fill out the post-event metrics on the event page you setup on the Reps portal
* Tell us about your event. This can be before and after. We love to hear about upcoming plans, and of course love to hear about what was achieved at the event with a picture or two!
    * [Here is the Discourse post to write to](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/activate-mozilla-e10s-compatibility-and-featured-add-ons/11193)
