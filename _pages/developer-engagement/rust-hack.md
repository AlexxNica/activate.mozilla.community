Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. [Find out more...](https://www.rust-lang.org)

## Activity Format

Get your community behind this exciting new programming language by running a learning event.

These sessions can be run two ways:

1. Ask a person with experience with Rust to attend and provide guidance to attendees. There are a few ways to try to find local Rust experts to invite:
    * Reach out to the [Community Team](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html#Community-team) - community-team [at] rust-lang [dot] org - they know the most active people in most regions.
    * Via the [user groups](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/user-groups.html)
    * At [rustaceans.org](http://www.rustaceans.org/)
2. If the facilitators have little or no Rust experience, turn it into a learning session for everyone, where you go through the steps together. Some Mozillians have already done such sessions. For example our [Community Spaces](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Participation/Community_Spaces) have, so you can reach out the them to ask for some guidance.

## Event Flow

* Install Rust
    * [rustup](www.rustup.rs) - recommended
    * [Rust downloads](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html) (alternative)
* Read the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
* Complete the [Rustlings](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings) (a great beginners course!)
* Some projects with great first bugs:
    * The Rust language and compiler
        * [Labeled easy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy)
        * [Labeled mentor](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-mentor)
    * [clippy - the popular Rust static analysis tool](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy)
    * [Cargo - Rust’s package manager](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy)
    * [rustfmt - the Rust source code formatting tool](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues)
        * Though some are without clear instructions, the domain is easy to understand (it's mostly manipulating strings), and potentially engaging.
    * [rustup - the Rust installer](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
    * Rust documentation
        * [Labeled easy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AA-docs+label%3AE-easy)
        * [Standard library API docs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29329)
    * [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) also publishes a call for participation each week with hot contribution ideas.

## Other Resources

### Tutorials

* [Niko Matsakis's excellent slide deck](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorials-keynote)
* [Exercises to accompany that deck](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorializer)
* [A screencast from Niko on ownership and borrowing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOiiIxbE6k)

## Output
Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things we’d like you, the event organizer, to do.

* Tell us about your event. This can be before or after. We love to hear about upcoming plans, and of course love to hear about what was achieved at the event with a picture or two!
    * [Here is the Discourse post to write to]()

## Extra
While the focus of this activity should be on these events, there are other ways to stay more involved with the Rust community after.

* Follow up with attendees to highlight [more things happening in the community to get involved with](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/community.html)
