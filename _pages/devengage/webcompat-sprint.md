Web Compatibility, the ability for all Web content to run in all browsers, is important. There are multiple web content engines running on multiple devices, and sometimes with a little testing and some small tweaks to their site, developers can ensure that more users can have the full experience that is desired. 

For more background and data on Web Compatibility, read the recent blog post on Mozilla Hacks:

## Activity Format

Run an event to get together people who care about the Web, to test sites, diagnose problems, and evangelise a web that works for everyone.

## Event Flow

* Set yourself up with Firefox. Any or all of the following versions:
    * [Firefox Beta 49+](https://www.mozilla.org//firefox/channel/)
    * [Firefox for Android Beta 49+](https://www.mozilla.org//firefox/channel/)
    * [Firefox for iOS](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/ios/)
* [Install the Webcompat.com Reporter add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/webcompatcom-reporter/)
    * We have a mobile add-on people can install for Fennec Beta and in version 50 there will be a default "Report Site Issue" menu item in Fennec Aurora and Nightly.
    * No add-ons support for iOS, but people can report bugs manually at [webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com)
* Choose the sites you want to test
    * We recommend the [Alexa Top 500](http://www.alexa.com/topsites) sites - either globally or by country
* Test and Report!
    * [Read the general guide](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Guide)
    * Pay special attention to what we are looking for [in reported issues](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Guide#Reporting_a_Web_compatibility_issue)
    * If you encounter something on the site not looking properly, or working correctly, then click the add-on button and follow the steps to report

## Output
Additional to the recommended event flow here are some things weâ€™d like you, the event organizer, to do.
